## ðŸ“Œ PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is the final and most advanced task of the CODTECH Python Internship Program. The objective of Task 4 is to create a **predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn** that can classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. The task focuses on core machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Spam detection is a classic problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and binary classification. The dataset used in this task contains labeled emails, where each message is categorized as spam or ham. The goal is to train a model that can automatically predict whether a new email is spam or not based on its content.

The project uses a cleaned dataset (commonly referred to as `spam.csv`) and applies text processing techniques such as **lowercasing**, **removing stopwords**, and **vectorizing** the text using **CountVectorizer**. The machine learning algorithm used for classification is **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, which is well-suited for text classification problems.

The model is trained using a portion of the dataset (training set) and then tested using a separate portion (test set). Evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and a **confusion matrix** are calculated to analyze the modelâ€™s performance. Additionally, a heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix helps interpret the results easily.

## LEARNING OUTCOME

This task was the most valuable in terms of real-world application of machine learning. I learned how to:
- Clean and prepare textual data
- Convert raw text into machine-readable vectors using CountVectorizer
- Apply the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify data
- Evaluate a model using standard classification metrics
- Visualize results with confusion matrices and accuracy plots

The project demonstrated the full lifecycle of a machine learning task â€” from loading and cleaning data, to training and evaluating a model, and saving final results. It was a strong foundation for future projects in data science, NLP, and AI. I now feel confident in applying Python and Scikit-learn to build similar classification systems for other datasets.
